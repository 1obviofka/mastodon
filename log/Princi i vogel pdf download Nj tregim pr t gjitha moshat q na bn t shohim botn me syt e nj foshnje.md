In a distant planet, the Little Prince met a geographer, who told him to visit Earth, a special and different planet from the others. When he arrived there, he was surprised to see no one. He felt sad, thinking he had mistaken the planet. Suddenly, the Little Prince met a snake[^2^].
 
The snake told him that he could help him go back to his planet by biting him and making him disappear. The Little Prince was curious about the snake's power, but he decided to explore Earth first. He walked for a long time, until he found a garden full of roses. He was happy to see them, because he thought they were like his rose, the one he had left on his planet.
 
But then he realized that his rose was not unique, as she had claimed. She was just one of thousands of roses. He felt betrayed and lonely. He wondered if he had any friends in the universe. He sat down and cried.
 
Then he heard a voice that said: "Good morning". It was a fox, who wanted to play with him. The Little Prince asked him what it meant to tame someone. The fox explained that it meant to create bonds of friendship and love, to make someone special and unique. He said that if the Little Prince tamed him, they would need each other and be happy together.
 
The Little Prince agreed to tame the fox, and they spent some time getting to know each other. The fox taught him that the essential things are invisible to the eye, and that one can only see well with the heart. He also told him that he was responsible for his rose, because he had tamed her.
 
The Little Prince understood that his rose was indeed unique and precious, because he loved her and she loved him back. He decided to go back to his planet and take care of her. He said goodbye to the fox, who gave him a secret as a gift: "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."
